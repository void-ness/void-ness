- 👋 Hi, I’m @void-ness
- 👀 I’m interested in creating user-friendly Websites
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, CSS and c++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on user-interactive applications or programs based on python and any Web Dev projects you may have in mind.
- 📫 How to reach me? message on github if that is possible(duh!). have you considered sending a white pigeon with a message on his leg?
